This is a collaborative School project I did with a few other Queens Engineering students. The final product is a "racoon deterrant" that activates a buzzer and sends the activation time through the arduino's network time protocols to a network-attatched device through the POST method.
** Device Hardware
- Arduino Uno Wi-Fi R3
- Bread Board
- Grove Human Presence Sensor
- Battery
- x2 220 Ohm Resistors
- Qkits Buzzer
